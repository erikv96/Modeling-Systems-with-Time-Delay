# Modeling-Systems-with-Time-Delay

The MATLAB code performs two key tasks:

-Simulates the delayed logistic growth model using dde23, showing how the system evolves for different values of Œª.
-Analyzes stability by solving the linearized perturbation equation, helping determine whether the equilibrium 
ùë¶=1 is stable (perturbations decay) or unstable (perturbations grow).
